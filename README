USE:
Current license: Agplv3. Will most probably be rereleased in a more permissive license at a later date. Contact me if you
are interessted in forking and would like a more permissive license.  (At least normal GPLv2, maybe also BSD). 

Idea:
Use advanced techniques for transforming data from digital video compression in an "analogue way",
i.e. only do steps which are continous (not discreete) and present the resulting values as symbols directly to 
an analogue modulator, basically taking soft symbols to the extreme. and sending ~10000 samples for each 4 gop
over an approx 2.4 khz link (2.7khz-3khz for codec2 audio, syncronization callsign etc).

Dependencies: Gnuradio for grc filters, numpy and pil for image conversion scripts. A c compiler.

Compression into analogue symbols for (hopefully one day) use over 2.7khz hf amateur radio links
* use imgconv.py to convert png files (dimensions 256x128 pixels x32frames) to raw files
* run cwttest to compress and decompress the files
* run one of the modemtest grc sheets to modulate and demodulate the compressed file.
* modify cwttest to enable the demod macro to demodulate the compressed file and view the demodulated data. 

btw code is made for prototyping, not to be pretty or efficient.
